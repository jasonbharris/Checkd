- Welcome to Checkd

This is a YouTube tutorial for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I wanted to put a new twist on building the conventional todo list
application and have a landing page, and an about page to help with
your learning. This way you know how to properly create the structure
of your HTML document and also how to go from one page to another
utilizing links.

This is a two part tutorial where I will be creating the landing and
about pages first so that you will know how to build a responsive
web application using only HTML and CSS. Then we will be building the
todo application in my Javascript Tutorial.

I hope that you enjoy the tutorials that I have created and if you
would like to support my channel all you have to do is buy me a cup of
coffee so that I will be able to create better tutorials for you to view
as I progress.

Now all you have to do is download the starter file where I have stored
the images that will be used throughout this tutorial and let's get
developing :).
